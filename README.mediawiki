= MediaWiki APNG Extension =

This is an extension of MediaWiki to enable animated PNG support in browsers
with canvas support.

Firefox and Opera until version 14 support APNG natively. This extension is
working on Chrome, Safari, Webkit-based Opera and Internet Explorer 9 or
higher.

Demo: [http://wiki.52poke.com/wiki/%E4%B8%83%E8%B3%A2%E4%BA%BA http://wiki.52poke.com/wiki/七賢人]

This extension is based on David Mzareulyan's [https://github.com/davidmz/apng-canvas apng-canvas library].
Thanks for the brilliant work.

== Requirements ==

APNG extension requires MediaWiki 1.17 and PHP 5.3 or higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'APNG' directory within your
MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add the following line to your
'LocalSettings.php' file:

    require_once( "$IP/extensions/APNG/APNG.php" );

If you use a different domain for your `$wgUploadPath`, the web server is
required to send a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header for PNG files.

For example, you can simply add the following lines to the location scope
of your Nginx configuration:

    if ($request_uri ~* \.png$) {
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
    }

Internet Explorer 9 is not supported in this case.
